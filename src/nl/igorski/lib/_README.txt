package nl.igorski.lib.ui

these contain a plethora of everyday "components" which are all ActionScript-based.

note that this entire package has been made by someone who will do his
utmost to NOT use the Adobe Flash IDE for his applications. As such
these components rely heavily on the graphics property of the Sprite class.

These components provide basic functionality for use in user interfaces. They
were meant to be extended ( override the "draw" methods for creating your
own styles ), but are ready to go. Initially they made use of the excellent
TweenMax tween library by Greensock for animation and visual feedback, but
these references have been removed so this package works from the get-go
using solely the Flex SDK 3.5.
